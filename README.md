# CNN
This repository contains code for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the Keras library in Python. The repository consists of several Jupyter notebooks, each of which demonstrates how to build a CNN for a different dataset.

The datasets used in the notebooks include:
- MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits.
- CIFAR-10: A dataset of 10 different classes of images, such as airplanes, cars, and dogs.
- Fashion-MNIST: A dataset of fashion items, such as shirts, shoes, and bags.

Each notebook follows a similar structure, in which the CNN architecture is defined, the data is loaded and preprocessed, the model is trained, and the performance is evaluated on a test set. The notebooks also include visualizations of the training and validation accuracy and loss, as well as sample predictions made by the model on test data.

Overall, your repository provides a useful resource for learning how to build and train CNNs in Keras for various image classification tasks. By following the examples provided in the notebooks, users can gain a better understanding of how to preprocess image data, define CNN architectures, and train and evaluate models using Keras.
